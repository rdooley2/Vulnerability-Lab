<h1>Vulnerability Management - Qualys</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration]()

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I used Qualys Community Edition to analyze my computer for Vulnerabilities. As I didn't expect many vulnerabilities, I also installed a very outdated version of Firefox onto my computer in hopes of detecting and remediating the problem. First, I installed a Qualys agent on my computer which allowed the web browser to connect with my PC. Secondly, I proceeded to run vulnerability scans within the Qualys Web Browser. Finally, I used the information from the scan to remediate all of the problems.
